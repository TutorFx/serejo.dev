At Implanta, I was entrusted with one of the biggest challenges of my career. With 20 years in the market, the company is already well-established, and I accepted the mission, alongside my friends from the Sépia team, to rebuild the tool that is the central pillar of the Implanta business: Cockpit 2.0.

This platform is the brain of distribution visibility. It is through it that the entire process of data extraction, integration, and processing for the analytics side takes place, including crucial functionalities such as stockout prediction, sellout forecasting, and the sales cube.

The major turning point was the architecture I designed for the interfaces. Instead of creating dozens of versions of the same software, I developed a rendering core that adapts dynamically. In practice, the API itself defines the structure, forms, and interactions of each screen in a modular way.

This approach was strategic for a crucial reason: our team was mostly composed of backend specialists. With this architecture, they gained the autonomy to build and modify screens directly via the API, without depending on a frontend development cycle for each adjustment.

Acting as the main architect of this front, the tool managed to unlock the team's productivity and ensure that the project advanced at an accelerated pace, even with a lean team. The result was a robust, scalable, and highly customizable product, delivered with a speed that was only possible thanks to this synergy. None of this would have been possible without the trust of our CTO, Allan Menezes, and his determination to offer the best tool a client can receive.
