At TLScontact, I perform a variety of tasks including implementing new features, mitigating vulnerabilities, and refactoring code. I work directly with institutional tools for issuing visas. The frameworks used are Vue 2 and Vue 3.

One of my main contributions within the project was the restructuring of the help module to a new architecture. Specifically, I extracted the module from the hexagonal architecture and migrated it to a "Feature Services" architecture. This change brought value and sustainability to the project.
