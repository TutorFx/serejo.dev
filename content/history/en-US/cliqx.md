As a Front\-End developer at Cliqx, I worked on several projects, mostly software for the retail market. My main contribution was structuring an application for Pernambucanas, where I proposed the use of the Nuxt3 framework and collaborated on the application development using a hexagonal architecture with service layers. Overall, the project was designed with a scalable strategy using Redis, SWR, and Nuxt3 to reduce server workload.
