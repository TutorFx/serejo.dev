- I delivered complete, end-to-end web solutions for multiple clients, managing the
  entire project lifecycle from UI/UX design to full-stack implementation and deployment.
- I developed and launched websites for prominent local companies, including Cremozinn,
  establishing their digital presence in the market.
- I enhanced client projects by developing and integrating small-scale AI solutions
  using the GPT-3 API with Python and Node.js.
- I started using OpenAI's API to automate tedious processes. As specialized frameworks weren't available at the time, I developed custom wrapping strategies using Regex and Zod.
