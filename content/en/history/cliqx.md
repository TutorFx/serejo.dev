At Cliqx, I was involved in the front-end development of an application for Pernambucanas. I contributed to structuring the application using a hexagonal architecture with service layers. In collaboration with the backend development team, we devised a scalable strategy using Redis, SWR, and Nuxt3 to reduce server workload. We worked under the Kanban methodology, which helped us manage work efficiently. By the time I left the company, the application had achieved 90% test coverage.
