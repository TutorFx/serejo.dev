At UniFAJ, an educational institution, I was tasked with developing an onboarding application for students. We used Nuxt2 and Vuetify for front-end development and held daily meetings to align deliveries. My responsibilities included implementing new features and restructuring legacy code, adhering to clean code principles. I was also responsible for coordinating with the backend team to align the delivery of new features. We utilized the Scrum methodology in this project.
