In my current role at TLScontact, I have had the opportunity to grow both professionally and personally, working on a variety of tasks that include implementing new features, mitigating vulnerabilities, and participating in daily reviews with team members from around the globe. I develop various institutional tools for visa issuance, working with both Vue 3 and 2 in my daily tasks.

One of my notable achievements was restructuring the entire help module for a new architecture, specifically a hexagonal architecture, and migrating it to the Feature Services architecture. This added more value and sustainability to the code. I have been studying Node.js for 5 years and applying it (Nest.js and H3) in personal projects, and just over a year ago, I started studying Java Springboot.

Among my job duties, I speak daily with people from all over the world, aligning strategies with both the backend and frontend teams.
