At ITH Pós-Graduação, I was involved in the development of a front-end for their legacy project. I developed an application using Nuxt2 that consumed an endpoint I created on their WordPress. This led to significant improvements in the Google Speed Insights results for the company. My responsibilities also included website and API development, gamification of courses, and managing the online user experience.
