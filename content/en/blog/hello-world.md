Hello, welcome ðŸ˜Š

I am Gabriel Serejo Sorrentino, a fullstack developer and kart driver in my spare time. I have been passionate about technology since I was very young. Curiosity doesn't always lead me to answers, but it has always led me to the right questions. Today I am 26 years old, and my search for answers has never been more alive.

I am currently busy with projects of all kinds. The list is long, from developing complete web applications with Nuxt3, to web scrapers made in Python. I am currently adapting my workflow to include Java to my main stack. So you will probably see something about it very soon.

I also have a very cool background as a designer. For a long time, I worked exclusively as a graphic animator and produced countless audiovisual materials. I produced After Effects and Apple Motion templates for audiovisual product companies.

Nowadays, I take motion as a hobby. Sometimes I open Blender to play around with some renders, but nothing with the aim of earning extra money.

A few years ago, when I was still working at Ledwave, I realized that I had a knack for it when I created an email marketing campaign using the Maizzle library. I had already had other projects, but they didn't have that weight yet. We are talking about a multinational company, Ledwave. I made landing pages, sometimes I would escape from my department and spend time with the IT guys.

During my time at Ledwave, something funny is that, even with all the stigma of 'marketing people not liking to mix with IT people', I was the middleman and established a smooth communication between these two teams.

Anyway, middlewares are not just for authentication ~badum tss...~

One cool contribution I made recently was a web application for talent recruitment at Pernambucanas. And it was amazing...

I had the opportunity to develop my Typescript skills a lot, as I had total freedom from the techleader to create the application base, implement the design system and the cache system with Redis. The application could receive 3,000 clicks/second, which it would be able to perform well. And believe me, our red team tried to bring it down in every way possible. Nuxt3 + AWS Amplify + Redis are great for scaling in this scenario.

So reader... I'm getting carried away, I think that's enough for this introduction. The next posts will be more informative, I'll talk more about strategies on how to make your Nuxt3 application scale, talk about news. Like, Tailwind 4 and Nuxt 4 are coming. Is it a sign? Illuminati confirmed?

Thank you reader, if you made it this far. See you soon!
