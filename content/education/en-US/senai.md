The Computer Networks I and II courses allowed me to delve into the infrastructure that connects the world. I learned about the protocols, architectures, and challenges involved in building and maintaining efficient and secure networks. Security, in fact, was also a central theme in Information Security, where I gained an understanding of cyber threats and strategies to protect data and systems.
The foundation for this journey was built in Algorithms and Programming Logic. Developing logical thinking and the ability to solve problems through code was essential to my growth. The acquired knowledge was put into practice in the Web Programming I and II courses, where I learned how to build dynamic and interactive websites and web applications.
Software development also played a significant role in my education. Systems Analysis and Design I and II equipped me to understand the software life cycle, from conception to implementation and maintenance. Agile Methodologies for Software Development and Improvement introduced me to modern and efficient approaches for managing projects and teams.
Finally, Software Quality Management showed me the importance of ensuring the quality and reliability of the systems we develop.
Beyond the technical aspects, the university provided me with a broad perspective on the impact of technology on society. The Digital Law course brought me important reflections on the ethical and legal issues surrounding the use of technology.
